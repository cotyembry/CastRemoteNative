started on revamp of CastRemote 
1h 15m later I am not getting cocoapods setup and installing the google cast sdk pod (its 1:40am)

04-03-2017 I have worked quite a bit on this, probably like 3 days or more worth since writing anything down (i.e. the first entry above)
	since then I have gotten cocoapods linked, written custome native code in swift (and a little in objective-c just for reerence if I ever need it) and have bridged this to javascript.
	The app is functiional, but now I have to work on the aesthetics of it lol

	I am starting to try to use svg like modules to create styling for the view (let's hope it looks great!)

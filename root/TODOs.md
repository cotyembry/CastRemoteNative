TODO:
	Label.jsx
		convert pseudo code and comments into actual js

	SeekInput.jsx
		"	"	"


	-Add min widths to components to make the view still look presentable when the keyboard gets shown

	-add delay where after selecting 'seek', the numbers stay in there for a like 5 seconds, then they clear
		add a clear button that works for both text input boxes

	-//TODO: check to see if I need to optimize this .scan method in DeviceManager.swift to handle intelligently when it is called multiple times (i.e. keeping the code from recreating a class instance in its place, etc)
